This is a program used to build a circuit that counts up from 0 to 9 using 4 T Flip-Flops. The connections between the input and output ports of the Flip-Flops are designed based on the corresponding truth table for a decimal up-counter circuit. This is also one of my very first code programs when I first started learning this language.
